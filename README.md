## Repository guide

This repository was created to store the source codes of the second practical project of the discipline "Artificial Neural Networks" 2020.1

Team:
Bonifácio de Oliveira;
Luiz Felipe;
Luiz Fabio;
Rafaela Melo.


## About the files

The proposed problems are available at:

1) "Problems.pdf".

The Dataset's that have been used are available at:

1) "dataAll.txt";
2) "data1.txt";
3) "dataHoldout.txt".

The problems proposed by the practical project were allocated as follows:

1) Problem of subsection 2.1;
2) Problem of subsection 2.2;
2) Problem of subsection 2.3.

Each solution to a problem was solved by a ".ipynb" file, being grouped sequentially into:

1) "Part 1.ipynb" -> For the first problem;
2) "Part 2.ipynb" -> For the second problem;
2) "Part 3.ipynb" -> For the third problem.

## About the Neuron

Well, let's understand a little about the main attributes of the Neuron class built.

`` python
# Creation of the neuron class
n = Neuron ()

# Neuron dataset
n.data
# Training data set
n.x_training
# Test data set
n.x_test
# Set of neuron weights
n.weights
# Value of ϑ
n.teta
# Learning rate value
n.ta
# Bias value
n.vies
# Set of adjustments made
n.total_of_adjustments
# Total season value
n.time
# Point values to construct the line generated by the neuron
n.x1
n.x2
